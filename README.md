# Insanity Houserules Cards for Mansions of Madness 2nd Ed

Based on [Veggiesama's Insanity Houserules](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/137810/insanity-conditions-descriptions-tips-1-page)
and modified to add Insanity Cards from expansions "Beyond the Threshold"
and "Streets of Arkham."

The base Insanity cards aren't a whole lot of fun to play (in my opinion,
of course). So these cards change, in some cases completely, the originals.

As an added benefit, the cards describe game rules that an Insane player
might find useful that aren't commonly used by the sane players. For
example, how to steal from your fellow investigators.
